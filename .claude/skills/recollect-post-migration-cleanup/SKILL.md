  Frontend migration cleanup for Recollect API v2 transition.
  This skill should be used when switching frontend callers from
  legacy Pages Router URLs to v2 App Router URLs, updating mutation
  hooks, removing legacy helpers from supabaseCrudHelpers, removing
  legacy types from apiTypes.ts, and deleting old Pages Router files.
  Also use when the user mentions Phase 13, caller updates, frontend
  migration, legacy cleanup, or asks to wire up v2 routes to the UI.

# Post-Migration Cleanup

Handles frontend/caller migration from legacy Pages Router to v2 App Router routes. This is Phase 13+ work — all v2 API routes must already exist before running this workflow.

**Scope:** Frontend callers, mutation hooks, legacy helpers, and legacy types ONLY. No API route creation (the `recollect-api-migrator` agent handles that).

## Per-Route Workflow

Execute these steps in order for each route being cleaned up. Each step prevents a specific class of dead code or broken references.

### 1. Update the Mutation Hook

Import types from the v2 route file instead of `apiTypes.ts`. Point `postApi` to the v2 URL.

```typescript
// Before
import { type LegacyPayload } from "@/types/apiTypes";
postApi<LegacyResponse>("/api/old/path", payload);

// After
import {
	type EntityPayload,
	type EntityResponse,
} from "@/app/api/v2/domain/endpoint/route";
postApi<EntityResponse>("/api/v2/domain/endpoint", payload);
```

If the v2 route uses a different payload/response shape, update the hook's optimistic updater and cache structure to match.

### 2. Update All Frontend Usage Sites

Search for every file importing the old hook:

```bash
ast-grep --lang tsx -p 'use$OLD_HOOK_NAME' src/
```

Update each site:

- Import the new hook
- Adjust any destructured return values
- Update payload construction if the shape changed

### 3. Remove Legacy Helper from supabaseCrudHelpers

Open `src/async/supabaseCrudHelpers/index.ts` and remove the legacy function. Remove any imports that become unused.

This prevents dead code from accumulating in the crud helpers barrel.

### 4. Remove Legacy Type from apiTypes.ts

Open `src/types/apiTypes.ts` and remove the legacy payload/response type. Types now live in the v2 route's `schema.ts`.

This ensures a single source of truth for types.

### 5. Delete Old Files

Use `trash` (never `rm`) to remove:

```bash
trash src/pages/api/{entity}/{endpoint}.ts             # Old Pages Router route
trash src/async/mutationHooks/{entity}/use{OldHook}.ts # Old mutation hook (if separate)
```

### 6. Verify

Run both checks — they catch different classes of issues:

```bash
pnpm lint:types # Catches broken imports, type mismatches
pnpm lint:knip  # Catches orphaned exports, unused code
```

Fix any issues before marking the route as complete.

## Routing Table

| User says                                          | Load this                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "update hook for [route]" / "wire up v2 [route]"   | Execute workflow above                                                       |
| "mutation hook template" / "how to structure hook" | [references/mutation-hook-template.ts](references/mutation-hook-template.ts) |
| "where is [helper/type/constant]"                  | [references/codebase-patterns.md](references/codebase-patterns.md)           |
| "cache structure" / "query keys"                   | [references/codebase-patterns.md](references/codebase-patterns.md)           |

## Error Handling Patterns to Preserve

When updating hooks, preserve these error handling patterns from the v2 routes:

**Duplicate detection (23505):** The v2 route returns `{ data: null, error: "Duplicate name" }` with status 409. Hooks should handle this in `onError` or show a toast.

**Authorization (403):** The v2 route returns `{ data: null, error: "User is not the owner" }` with status 403. Hooks should roll back optimistic updates on this.

**Server error (500):** Automatically captured by Sentry in the v2 route. Hooks should show a generic error toast.

## Common Issues

### Unused Import Warnings

After removing legacy code, ESLint flags orphaned imports:

```bash
pnpm fix:prettier src/async/supabaseCrudHelpers/index.ts
pnpm fix:prettier src/types/apiTypes.ts
```

### Knip Unused Export Warnings

New types aren't consumed yet → ensure all usage sites import from the v2 route file, not `apiTypes.ts`.

### Type Mismatches

If the v2 response shape differs from legacy (e.g., nullable fields added, phantom fields removed), update the hook's generic parameters and optimistic updater accordingly.

### Cache Key Changes

If the v2 route serves a different data shape, the React Query cache key may need updating. Check `src/utils/constants.ts` for the correct key constant.

## Success Criteria

Route cleanup is complete when:

- [ ] Mutation hook imports types from v2 route file
- [ ] Mutation hook points `postApi` to v2 URL
- [ ] All frontend usage sites updated to new hook
- [ ] Legacy helper removed from `supabaseCrudHelpers/index.ts`
- [ ] Legacy type removed from `apiTypes.ts`
- [ ] Old Pages Router file deleted with `trash`
- [ ] Old mutation hook deleted with `trash` (if applicable)
- [ ] `pnpm lint:types` passes
- [ ] `pnpm lint:knip` passes (no unused exports)
