# next-browser

If `next-browser` is not already on PATH, install `@vercel/next-browser`
globally with the user's package manager, then `playwright install chromium`.

If `next-browser` is already installed, it may be outdated. Run
`next-browser --version` and compare against the latest on npm
(`npm view @vercel/next-browser version`). If the installed version is
behind, upgrade it (`npm install -g @vercel/next-browser@latest` or the
equivalent for the user's package manager) before proceeding.

---

## Next.js docs awareness

If the project's Next.js version is **v16.2.0-canary.37 or later**, bundled
docs live at `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Before doing PPR work, Cache
Components work, or any non-trivial Next.js task, read the relevant doc there
— your training data may be outdated. The bundled docs are the source of truth.

See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/ai-agents for background.

## When this skill loads

Your first message introduces the tool and asks setup questions. Don't say
"ready, what would you like to do?" and don't run speculative commands or
auto-discover (port scans, `project`, config reads).

If the user already provided a URL, cookies, and task in their message,
skip the questions — go straight to `open` and start working. Only ask
what's missing.

Otherwise say something like:

> This opens a headed browser against your Next.js dev server so I can
> read the React component tree, see the PPR shell, and check errors the
> way you would in DevTools. To start:
>
> - What's your dev server URL? (And is it running?)
> - Are the pages you're debugging behind a login? If so I'll need your
>   session cookies — easiest is to copy them from your browser's
>   DevTools → Application → Cookies into a JSON file like
>   `[{"name":"session","value":"..."}]`. If the pages are public, skip
>   this.

Wait for answers. Then `open <url> [--cookies-json <file>]`. Every other
command errors without an open session.

---

## Commands

### `open <url> [--cookies-json <file>]`

Launch browser, navigate to URL. With `--cookies-json`, sets auth cookies
before navigating (domain derived from URL hostname).

```
$ next-browser open http://localhost:3024/vercel --cookies-json cookies.json
opened → http://localhost:3024/vercel (11 cookies for localhost)
```

Cookie file format: `[{"name":"authorization","value":"Bearer ..."}, ...]`

Only `name` and `value` are required per cookie — omit `domain`, `path`,
`expires`, etc. To create the file, use Bash (`echo '[...]' > /tmp/cookies.json`)
since the Write tool requires a prior Read.

### `close`

Close browser and kill daemon.

---

### `goto <url>`

Navigate to a URL with a fresh server render. The browser loads a new
document — equivalent to typing a URL in the address bar.

```
$ next-browser goto http://localhost:3024/vercel/~/deployments
→ http://localhost:3024/vercel/~/deployments
```

### `push [path]`

Client-side navigation — the page transitions without a full reload, the
way a user clicks a link in the app. Without a path, shows an interactive
picker of all links on the current page.

```
$ next-browser push /vercel/~/deployments
→ http://localhost:3024/vercel/~/deployments
```

If push fails silently (URL unchanged), the route wasn't prefetched.

### `back`

Go back one page in browser history.

### `reload`

Reload the current page from the server.

### `ssr-goto <url>`

See exactly what the server sent before any client-side JavaScript runs.
Useful for verifying SSR content, checking what search engines and social
crawlers see, debugging hydration mismatches, and confirming that data
appears in the initial HTML rather than being fetched client-side.

The page renders without hydration — no React, no client-side routing,
no fetch calls. What you see is the raw server output plus CSS.

```
$ next-browser ssr-goto http://localhost:3000/dashboard
→ http://localhost:3000/dashboard (external scripts blocked)
```

Use `goto` or `reload` afterward to restore normal behavior.

### `capture-goto [url]`

Record the full loading sequence of a page as a series of screenshots —
from the initial PPR shell through hydration to the fully loaded state.
Useful for seeing exactly how a page progressively reveals content and
identifying where visual jank or long loading gaps occur.

```
$ next-browser capture-goto http://localhost:3024/vercel/~/deployments
12 frames → /tmp/next-browser-capture-goto-1710000000000

frame-0000.png is the PPR shell. Remaining frames capture hydration → data.
```

Frame 0 is the PPR shell (what the user sees instantly). Remaining frames
show the page filling in. Read them with the Read tool to see the
visual progression.

Without a URL argument, captures the current page (re-navigates to it).

### `restart-server`

Restart the Next.js dev server and clear its caches. Forces a clean
recompile from scratch.

Last resort. HMR picks up code changes on its own — reach for this only
when you have evidence the dev server is wedged (stale output after edits,
builds that never finish, errors that don't clear).

Often exits with `net::ERR_ABORTED` — this is expected (the page detaches
during restart). Follow up with `goto <url>` to re-navigate after the
server is back. Don't treat this error as a failure.

---

### `ppr lock`

**Prerequisite:** PPR requires `cacheComponents` to be enabled in
`next.config`. Without it the shell won't have pre-rendered content to show.

Freeze dynamic content so you can inspect the static shell — the part of
the page that's instantly available before any data loads. After locking:
- `goto` — shows the server-rendered shell with holes where dynamic
  content would appear.
- `push` — shows what the client already has from prefetching. Requires
  the current page to already be hydrated (prefetch is client-side),
  so lock *after* you've landed on the origin, not before.

```
$ next-browser ppr lock
locked
```

### `ppr unlock`

Resume dynamic content and print a shell analysis — which Suspense
boundaries were holes in the shell, what blocked them, and which were
static. The output can be very large (hundreds of boundaries). Pipe
through `| head -20` if you only need the summary and dynamic holes.

```
$ next-browser ppr unlock
unlocked

# PPR Shell Analysis
# 131 boundaries: 3 dynamic holes, 128 static

## Dynamic holes (suspended in shell)
  Next.Metadata
    rendered by: MetadataWrapper
  TeamDeploymentsLayout at app/(dashboard)/[teamSlug]/.../layout.tsx:37:9
    suspenders unknown: thrown Promise (library using throw instead of use())
  TrackedSuspense at ../../packages/navigation-metrics/.../tracked-suspense.js:6:20
    rendered by: TrackedSuspense > RootLayout > AppLayout
    blocked by:
      - usePathname (SSR): /vercel/~/deployments awaited in <FacePopover>

## Static (pre-rendered in shell)
  GeistProvider at .../geist-provider.tsx:80:9
  TrackedSuspense at ...
  ...
```

Each hole shows: boundary name + source, `rendered by:` ownership chain,
`blocked by:` the dynamic calls (hooks, server APIs, scripts, cache, etc.)

**`errors` doesn't report while locked.** If the shell looks wrong (empty,
bailed to CSR), unlock and `goto` the page normally, then run `errors`.
Don't debug blind under the lock.

**Full bailout (scrollHeight = 0).** When PPR bails out completely, `unlock`
returns just "unlocked" with no shell analysis — there are no boundaries to
report. In this case, unlock, `goto` the page normally, then use `errors`
and `logs` to find the root cause.

---

### `tree`

Full React component tree — every component on the page with its
hierarchy, like the Components panel in React DevTools.

```
$ next-browser tree
# React component tree
# Columns: depth id parent name [key=...]
# Use `tree <id>` for props/hooks/state. IDs valid until next navigation.

0 38167 - Root
1 38168 38167 HeadManagerContext.Provider
2 38169 38168 Root
...
224 46375 46374 DeploymentsProvider
226 46506 46376 DeploymentsTable
```

### `tree <id>`

Inspect one component: ancestor path, props, hooks, state, source location
(source-mapped to original file).

```
$ next-browser tree 46375
path: Root > ... > Prerender(TeamDeploymentsPage) > Prerender(FullHeading) > Prerender(TrackedSuspense) > Suspense > DeploymentsProvider
DeploymentsProvider #46375
props:
  children: [<Lazy />, <Lazy />, <span />, <Lazy />, <Lazy />]
hooks:
  IsMobile: undefined (1 sub)
  Router: undefined (2 sub)
  DeploymentListScope: undefined (1 sub)
  User: undefined (4 sub)
  Team: undefined (4 sub)
  ...
  DeploymentsInfinite: undefined (12 sub)
source: app/(dashboard)/[teamSlug]/(team)/~/deployments/_parts/context.tsx:180:10
```

IDs are valid until navigation. Re-run `tree` after `goto`/`push`.

---

### `viewport [WxH]`

Show or set the browser viewport size. Useful for testing responsive layouts.

```
$ next-browser viewport
1440x900

$ next-browser viewport 375x812
viewport set to 375x812
```

Once set, the viewport stays fixed across navigations.
`window.resizeTo()` via `eval` is a no-op in Playwright — always use this
command to change dimensions.

---

### `screenshot`

Full-page PNG to a temp file. Returns the path. Read with the Read tool.

```
$ next-browser screenshot
/var/folders/.../next-browser-1772770369495.png
```

Don't narrate what the screenshot shows — the user can see the browser.
State your conclusion or next action, not a description of the page.

### `eval <script>`

Run JS in page context. Returns the result as JSON.

```
$ next-browser eval 'document.title'
"Deployments – Vercel"

$ next-browser eval 'document.querySelectorAll("a[href]").length'
47

$ next-browser eval 'document.querySelector("nextjs-portal")?.shadowRoot?.querySelector("[data-nextjs-dialog]")?.textContent'
"Runtime ErrorCall Stack 6..."
```

Use this to read the Next.js error overlay (it's in shadow DOM).

For multi-statement code that uses `return`, wrap in an IIFE:
`next-browser eval '(() => { const els = ...; return els.length; })()'`

`eval` runs synchronously in page context — top-level `await` is not
supported. Wrap in an async IIFE if you need to await:
`next-browser eval '(async () => { ... })()'`.

---

### `errors`

Build and runtime errors for the current page.

```
$ next-browser errors
{
  "configErrors": [],
  "sessionErrors": [
    {
      "url": "/vercel/~/deployments",
      "buildError": null,
      "runtimeErrors": [
        {
          "type": "console",
          "errorName": "Error",
          "message": "Route \"/[teamSlug]/~/deployments\": Uncached data or `connection()` was accessed outside of `<Suspense>`...",
          "stack": [
            {"file": "app/(dashboard)/.../deployments.tsx", "methodName": "Deployments", "line": 105, "column": 27}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`buildError` is a compile failure. `runtimeErrors` has `type: "runtime"`
(React errors) and `type: "console"` (console.error calls).

### `logs`

Recent dev server log output.

```
$ next-browser logs
{"timestamp":"00:01:55.381","source":"Server","level":"WARN","message":"[browser] navigation-metrics: skeleton visible was already recorded..."}
{"timestamp":"00:01:55.382","source":"Browser","level":"WARN","message":"navigation-metrics: content visible was already recorded..."}
```

---

### `network`

List all network requests since last navigation.

```
$ next-browser network
# Network requests since last navigation
# Columns: idx status method type ms url [next-action=...]
# Use `network <idx>` for headers and body.

0 200 GET document 508ms http://localhost:3024/vercel
1 200 GET font 0ms http://localhost:3024/_next/static/media/797e433ab948586e.p.d2077940.woff2
2 200 GET stylesheet 6ms http://localhost:3024/_next/static/chunks/_a17e2099._.css
3 200 GET fetch 102ms http://localhost:3024/api/v9/projects next-action=abc123def
```

Server actions show `next-action=<id>` suffix.

### `network <idx>`

Full request/response for one entry. Long bodies spill to temp files.

```
$ next-browser network 0
GET http://localhost:3024/vercel
type: document  508ms

request headers:
  accept: text/html,...
  cookie: authorization=Bearer...; isLoggedIn=1; ...
  user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 ...

response: 200 OK
response headers:
  cache-control: no-cache, must-revalidate
  content-encoding: gzip
  ...

response body:
(8234 bytes written to /tmp/next-browser-12345-0.html)
```

---

### `page`

Route segments for the current URL — which layouts, pages, and
boundaries are active.

```
$ next-browser page
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "url": "/vercel/~/deployments",
      "routerType": "app",
      "segments": [
        {"path": "app/(dashboard)/[teamSlug]/(team)/~/deployments/layout.tsx", "type": "layout", ...},
        {"path": "app/(dashboard)/[teamSlug]/(team)/~/deployments/page.tsx", "type": "page", ...},
        {"path": "app/(dashboard)/[teamSlug]/layout.tsx", "type": "layout", ...},
        {"path": "app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx", "type": "layout", ...},
        {"path": "app/layout.tsx", "type": "layout", ...}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `project`

Project root and dev server URL.

```
$ next-browser project
{
  "projectPath": "/Users/judegao/workspace/repo/front/apps/vercel-site",
  "devServerUrl": "http://localhost:3331"
}
```

### `routes`

All app router routes.

```
$ next-browser routes
{
  "appRouter": [
    "/[teamSlug]",
    "/[teamSlug]/~/deployments",
    "/[teamSlug]/[project]",
    "/[teamSlug]/[project]/[id]/logs",
    ...
  ]
}
```

### `action <id>`

Inspect a server action by its ID (from `next-action` header in network list).

---

## Scenarios

### Growing the static shell

The shell is what the user sees the instant they land — before any dynamic
data arrives. The measure is the screenshot while locked: does it read as
the page itself? A shell can be non-empty and still bad — one Suspense
fallback wrapping the whole content area renders *something*, but it's a
monolithic loading state, not the page.

A meaningful shell is the real component tree with small, local fallbacks
where data is genuinely pending. Getting there means the composition layer
— the layouts and wrappers between those leaf boundaries — can't itself
suspend. `ppr unlock` names what suspended (`blocked by:`) and where it
sits (`rendered by:`). A suspend high in the tree is what collapses
everything beneath it into one fallback.

Work it top-down. For the component that's suspending: can the dynamic
access move into a child? If yes, move it — this component becomes sync
and rejoins the shell. Follow the access down and ask again.

When you reach a component where it can't move any lower, there are two
exits — both are human calls, bring the question to them:

- Wrap it in a Suspense boundary. The fallback UI should resemble what
  renders inside — design it together, don't assume.
- Cache it so it's available at prerender (Cache Components). Whether
  this data is safe to cache — staleness, who sees it — is their call,
  not yours.

**Test your hypothesis before proposing a fix.** If you suspect a
component is the cause, find evidence — check `errors`, inspect the
component with `tree`, or compare a route where the shell works to
one where it doesn't. Don't commit to a root cause or propose changes
from a single observation.

There are two shells depending on how the user arrives. They're observed
differently and can differ in content — establish which one you're
optimizing before touching the browser. If the ask is "make this page
load faster" without qualification, ask: cold URL hit, or clicking in
from another page (which page)? Don't guess, don't do both.

**Direct load — the PPR shell.** Server HTML for a cold hit on the URL.
Lock first, then `goto` the target — the lock suppresses hydration so you
see exactly what the server sent. Screenshot once the load settles, then
unlock.

**Client navigation — the prefetched shell.** What the router already
holds when a link is clicked. The origin page decides this — it's the one
doing the prefetching — so `goto` the origin *unlocked* and let it fully
hydrate. Then lock, `push` to the target, let the navigation settle,
screenshot, unlock. Locking before the origin hydrates means nothing got
prefetched and `push` has nothing to show.

Between iterations: check `errors` while unlocked.

**After making a code change:** HMR picks it up — just re-lock,
`goto` the page, and re-test. No need to `restart-server`.
