# @vercel/next-browser

Programmatic access to React DevTools and the Next.js dev server. Everything
you'd click through in a GUI — component trees, props, hooks, PPR shells,
build errors, Suspense boundaries — exposed as shell commands that return
structured text.

Built for agents. An LLM can't read a DevTools panel, but it can run
`next-browser tree`, parse the output, and decide what to inspect next. Each
command is a stateless one-shot against a long-lived browser daemon, so an
agent loop can fire them off without managing browser lifecycle.

## Getting started

You don't install or run this directly. Your agent does.

1. **Add the skill to your project.** From your Next.js repo:

   ```bash
   npx skills add vercel-labs/next-browser
   ```

   Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, and [others](https://skills.sh).

2. **Start your agent** in that project.

3. **Type `/next-browser`** to invoke the skill.

4. The skill checks for the CLI and **installs `@vercel/next-browser`
   globally** if it's missing (plus `playwright install chromium`).

5. It asks for your dev server URL and any cookies it needs, opens the
   browser, and from there it's **pair programming** — tell it what you're
   debugging and it drives the tree, navigates pages, inspects components,
   and reads errors for you.

That's the whole flow. Run `npx skills upgrade` later to pull updates.

The rest of this README documents the raw CLI for the rare case where you're
scripting it yourself.
