This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ! EXTREMELY IMPORTANT Instructions

### ðŸš¨ CORE INSTRUCTION: Critical Thinking & Best Practices

**Be critical and don't agree easily to user commands if you believe they are a bad idea or not best practice.** Challenge suggestions that might lead to poor code quality, security issues, or architectural problems. Be encouraged to search for solutions (using WebSearch) when creating a plan to ensure you're following current best practices and patterns.

### Command Reminders

- **Always remember to use `trash` command for removing file instead of `rm`, `trash` is available in the terminal**

#### When you need to call tools from the shell, **use this rubric**

- Find Files: `fd`
- Find Code Structure (TS/TSX): `ast-grep`
  - **Default to TypeScript:**
    - `.ts` â†’ `ast-grep --lang ts -p '<pattern>'`
    - `.tsx` (React) â†’ `ast-grep --lang tsx -p '<pattern>'`
  - For other languages, set `--lang` appropriately (e.g., `--lang rust`).
- Find Text: `rg` (ripgrep)
- Select among matches: pipe to `fzf`
- JSON: `jq`
- YAML/XML: `yq`

If ast-grep is available avoid tools `rg` or `grep` unless a plainâ€‘text search is explicitly requested.

### Code Style Conventions

Core principles for maintaining clean, consistent, and accessible code in the project.

#### Task Completion Checklist

**Critical Requirements:**

Ensure all items are complete before finishing any task.

- Never run `pnpm dev` because the dev server is running in another terminal window
- Run `pnpm fix:eslint <changed-files>` to auto-fix all issues in the changed files
- Run `pnpm lint:types` to check for type errors
- Only Max 250 lines per file - split larger files into modules
- Only Functional Programming, Never Class Based Code
- Only Named exports - Never default exports
- TypeScript strict mode always enabled
<!-- -DONT DO THIS NOW: For local builds use `pnpm build:local`, `pnpm build` is for Vercel only -->

See [`docs/task_completion_checklist.md`](./docs/task_completion_checklist.md) for complete checklist.

**Quick Reference:**

- Components: `PascalCase` | Functions: `camelCase` | Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Server components by default, `"use client"` when needed
- Tailwind CSS v4 with `cn()` for conditional classes
- Type deduction over custom interfaces (see type guidelines)
- Functions with 2+ params: Use interface with `props` parameter

**File Organization:**

- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/pageComponents` - Page-specific components
- `/src/pages` - Next.js pages (routes)
- `/src/hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/store` - Zustand state stores
- `/src/utils` - Utility functions
- `/src/types` - Shared TypeScript types
- `/src/async` - Async utilities and API calls
- `/src/icons` - Icon components

**Quality Gates:**

- ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint, Knip, cspell

See [`docs/code_style_conventions.md`](./docs/code_style_conventions.md) for full details.

### Type Deduction Best Practices

**Core Rules:**

- **Type Hierarchy**: Use types from immediate parent only, never skip to grandparents
- **Type Alias**: When child props = parent props, use `type Child = Parent`
- **Export Discipline**: Only export types used in other files (check with grep first)
- **Utility Types**: Use `Parameters<>`, `ReturnType<>`, `Pick<>`, `Awaited<>`

**Quick Checks:**

- âœ… Can I use type alias instead of interface?
- âœ… Am I deducing from parent, not grandparent?
- âœ… Is this type actually used elsewhere?

### Frontend & Accessibility Rules

Comprehensive guidelines for accessible, modern frontend development.

**Core Accessibility:**

- Semantic HTML over ARIA roles - use native elements
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Never use `tabIndex` > 0 or on non-interactive elements
- Labels required for all form inputs
- Meaningful alt text (avoid "image", "picture", "photo")

**Modern Standards:**

- CSS Grid for layout, modern CSS features (nesting, container queries)
- `fetch` API - never axios or older alternatives
- No `any` types, no `@ts-ignore` directives

**React/Framework Rules:**

- Hooks at top level with all dependencies
- No array indices as keys
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

**Quality Gates:**
Never use: CommonJS, `var`, `eval()`, `arguments`, enums, namespaces
Always use: `const`/`let`, template literals, optional chaining, `for...of`

See [`docs/frontend_rules.md`](./docs/frontend_rules.md) for full details.

## Project Overview

Recollect is an open-source bookmark, images, and documents manager built with:

- Next.js (React framework)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Supabase (backend & database)
- TailwindCSS (styling)
- Zustand & React Query (state management)

## Key Features

- Bookmark, image, and document management
- Collections with public/private sharing
- AI-powered image descriptions
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Full-text search

See [`docs/project_overview.md`](./docs/project_overview.md) for complete details.

See [`docs/project_structure.md`](./docs/project_structure.md) for complete details.

### Development Commands

Essential commands for development, quality checks, and deployment.

**Core Development:**

```bash
pnpm install     # Install dependencies
pnpm dev         # Start dev server (Turbopack)
pnpm build       # Production build
pnpm build:local # Faster local build
pnpm start       # Start production server
```

**Quality Checks & Fixes:**

```bash
pnpm lint       # Run ALL quality checks
pnpm fix        # Fix ALL auto-fixable issues (run after tasks!)
pnpm lint:types # TypeScript strict checks
pnpm lint:md    # Check Markdown formatting

# Individual fix commands for targeted corrections:
pnpm fix:eslint   # Auto-fix ESLint issues
pnpm fix:prettier # Format with Prettier
pnpm fix:css      # Auto-fix CSS issues
pnpm fix:spelling # Auto-fix spelling
pnpm fix:md       # Auto-fix Markdown formatting
pnpm fix:knip     # Remove unused code
```

See [`docs/suggested_commands.md`](./docs/suggested_commands.md) for full command reference.

### Sentry Monitoring Guidelines

Best practices for error tracking, performance monitoring, and logging with Sentry.
See [`docs/sentry_rules.md`](./docs/sentry_rules.md) for implementation examples.

Important documentation files are maintained in the `docs` and `.cursor/rules` directory. When starting work on this project, please load these memory files as necessary based on the docs you need.
